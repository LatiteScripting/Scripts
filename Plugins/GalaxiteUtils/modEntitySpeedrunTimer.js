// Entity Speedrun Timer: Automates speedrun splits for The Entity.
// Chapter 1 splits are weird because you can know where other candies are; ask Kara about how she'd handle it. Chapter 2 is a lot more obvious.
// NOTE: Both Entity chapters open with the title clear AFTER (italicized) "But I can't get caught..." Which chapter you're playing can be determined by the first title.
/* CHAPTER 1:
- Game start: (title) "[italics] But I can't get caught..."
- Candy fed: (chat)
- Game over (win): (chat)
- Game over (lose): (chat)

/* CHAPTER 2:
- Game start: (title) "[italics] But I can't get caught..."
- Generator fixed: (chat) "Another generator has been fixed! Only [n] more need to be fixed before I can escape."
- Game over (win):
- Game over (lose):
