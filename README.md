# Latite Plugin API

The Latite Scripting/Plugin API is an advanced client-side Minecraft Scripting API for Latite Client. The API allows you to interact with many aspects of the Minecraft Windows 10/11 Edition client (while not allowing cheats).

### What is Latite Client?
Latite Client is a non-cheat modification for Minecraft Windows 10/11 Edition which has features ranging from world utility to visual mods and PVP-related utilities. 

### Restrictions
Some features in Latite Client Scripting are restricted. Features such as getting the entities, attacking entities, getting entity positions are limited to operators to prevent cheating.

Other things like world manipulation are only possible on local worlds.

### How to use this API
