# How to make a script

## Prerequisites
- A code editor or IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio)
- Some basic JS/TS experience to learn how the language works
- The definitions for autocomplete/checking

If you plan to debug using the Visual Studio workspace, click [here](https://github.com/LatiteScripting/Scripts/blob/master/debugging.md) (you need to install VS first though).  
### Useful info for JS/TS

## Setting up the workspace
Using JS with autocomplete (do //@ts-check at the top of the document) or TS is highly recommended.

If you want a simple template to get started with scripting, see the [scripting template](https://github.com/LatiteScripting/Template) repo

## OK, I did that, what now?
It's time to make some plugins!

You can debug your code using the Visual Studio workspace.

See the [documentation](https://latitescripting.github.io/) for everything you can do with the scripting API
